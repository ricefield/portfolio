			In Fall 2012 I enrolled in the Full-time Training in Anaheim (FTTA), a 2-year Bible truth and church service training program based in Anaheim, CA. As part of my program, I was assigned to various services, one of which was the Attendance Project, an internally developed and maintained web application used by all the students and training administrators here at the FTTA.

			<br><br>

			Initially, the project was a poorly maintained PHP project that was mostly spaghetti code, and the team had no formal development process. The project had been poorly architected from the beginning, and ballooned over many years as a result of non-technical oversight. I drafted a <a href="ap/state.pdf">proposal [pdf]</a> to revamp, firstly, <a href="ap/devprocess.docx">the development process [docx]</a>, and secondly, the stack and architecture of the project, that is, a full rewrite of the application.

			<br><br>

			As a result, a formal development process was constructed, with spec, design, coding standards, testing, and code review. Furthermore, we decided to rewrite the entire application, introducing an MVC framework (Django), a better version control system (Git + GitLab), and other industry-standard best practices.

			<br><br>

			We are currently in the process of the rewrite. I currently serve simultaneously as a product manager, defining and driving our development process, organizing and prioritizing tasks and modules, and meeting with users and training administrators to gather feedback and requirements; as a lead developer, architecting and implementing a central module of the project; and as a sysadmin, setting up our internal Git server and issue tracker, deploying a Django web application, and keeping the server running.

			During my winter interim of 2012, I decided use my free time to put together a project I had been wanting to build for awhile: an API for <a href="http://hymnal.net/">hymnal.net</a>. Hymnal.net is an online collection of hymns that I use often; I have often thought about various projects or utilities that could be built if the data on the site was machine-readable (case in point, many people have built scrapers to display the data in mobile appls and the like). However, instead of writing a scraper for every project that needed the hymn data, I thought I might as well go ahead and write an (unofficial) JSON API and take care of the problem once-for-all. 

			<br><br>

			Along the way, I was able to teach myself some new technologies: this was my first real project using Ruby (being more of a Python diehard), and I also got a chance to try the wonderful Sinatra microframework, as well as some useful Ruby libraries (e.g. Nokogiri). Lastly, I learned how to deploy on Heroku. Fun stuff. 

			You can check out the hymnalAPI project on <a href="https://github.com/ricefield/hymnalAPI">GitHub</a> or live at: <a href="http://hymnalapi.herokuapp.com/">hymnalapi.herokuapp.com</a>

		<h2><a name="tracts">Verse Cards</a></h2><hr>
			<p class="bodytext">

				A side project I worked on during my first term of the FTTA. I came up with the idea of having wallet-sized tracts a few years ago, thinking it would be nice to always have gospel materials on hand. Initial mockups didn't seem to work so well though, so the concept was dropped. 

				<br><br>

				Picking it up again, I decided on a simple format of having one verse and one footnote (from the <a href="http://recoveryversion.org">Recovery Version</a>), making sure to leave some space for contact info to be written. This ended up working well, though it still required a lot of kerning to get some text to fit properly. A very fun and rewarding project.

			<p class="bodytext">

				Another side project I worked on in my first term were gospel hymn tracts. In the FTTA, we go out regularly to preach the gospel. One approach we use to sing hymns and spiritual songs to people. After doing this a few times, my impression was that people enjoyed our singing, but they did not receive much content from it.

				<br><br>

				My idea was to create gospel tracts that had hymn lyrics on them. The idea was to give the tract to people, sing to them, and that way they could follow along with what we were singing. Below the hymn would be some verses or ministry materials that would show how the hymn comes from the Bible and relates to our experience, and could serve as a launchpad for us to speak something of the gospel (or for them to read later).

			In my last semester at Cal, my friends <a href="http://jessechen.net">Jesse Chen</a>, Nelson Hoang, and I decided to enter a hackathon hosted by the UC Berkeley <a href="http://stc.berkeley.edu/">Student Technology Council</a> (STC). Our app, which we hacked together in a few hours after learning Node.JS, placed third at the competition.

		<br><br>

			Later that semester, we decided to enter the STC's <a href="http://stc.berkeley.edu/competitions.htm#webappcomp">Web App Competition</a> and invited Mark Wei to join our team. Over the course of a month, we rewrote our entire app and submitted it to the competition, winning both the Grand Prize and the People's Choice Award <a href="http://inews.berkeley.edu/articles/Apr-May2012/STC-WebAppContest-winners">(link)</a>.

				Worked with my excellent teammates <a href="http://jessechen.net">Jesse Chen</a>, Woosuk Kim, Edmond Lo, and Mark Wei on this project for our Software Engineering (CS169) class. Our idea was to develop a text messaging client for blind users, that took morse code as input. Our unique take on the problem was to use the volume rocker buttons as the sole input method (both for navigation and text entry), to avoid the confusion and difficulty typically presented to blind users by touchscreens, which provide little to no tactile feedback.</p>

			<p class="bodytext">In Fall of 2010, I was recruited by a Berkeley alum who was bootstrapping his startup in the area to be a Product Manager. The team was small, around 5 people, mostly composed of students and alums from Cal. Originally, the founder's idea had to do with traffic safety, and building an app that would record and send incident reports to the police for drunk-drivers, red-light violations, etc. When that didn't work out, I suggested an idea revolving around location-based messaging, and a geo-enabled bulletin board, which we pivoted to working on.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">As a "Product Manager" I took care of defining the scope, the aim, the use cases of the product, and also worked with the team to prioritize the feature set we would ship. I also oversaw all the visual design, as well as all the aspects of the user experience; this means I also did most of the asset work for our iPhone client, and lots and lots of sketches and flows.
