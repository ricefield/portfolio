		<p class="bodytext">In my last semester at Cal, my friends <a href="http://jessechen.net">Jesse Chen</a>, Nelson Hoang, and I decided to enter a hackathon hosted by the UC Berkeley <a href="http://stc.berkeley.edu/">Student Technology Council</a> (STC). Our app, which we hacked together in a few hours after learning Node.JS, placed third at the competition.
		<br><br>
		Later that semester, we decided to enter the STC's <a href="http://stc.berkeley.edu/competitions.htm#webappcomp">Web App Competition</a> and invited Mark Wei to join our team. Over the course of a month, we rewrote our entire app and submitted it to the competition, winning both the Grand Prize and the People's Choice Award <a href="http://inews.berkeley.edu/articles/Apr-May2012/STC-WebAppContest-winners">(link)</a>.

		<h2><a name="blind.ly">Blind.ly Messenger</a></h2><hr>
			<p class="bodytext">Worked with my excellent teammates <a href="http://jessechen.net">Jesse Chen</a>, Woosuk Kim, Edmond Lo, and Mark Wei on this project for our Software Engineering (CS169) class. Our idea was to develop a text messaging client for blind users, that took morse code as input. Our unique take on the problem was to use the volume rocker buttons as the sole input method (both for navigation and text entry), to avoid the confusion and difficulty typically presented to blind users by touchscreens, which provide little to no tactile feedback.</p>

		<h2><a name="crumbs">Crumbs</a></h2><hr>
			<p class="bodytext">In Fall of 2010, I was recruited by a Berkeley alum who was bootstrapping his startup in the area to be a Product Manager. The team was small, around 5 people, mostly composed of students and alums from Cal. Originally, the founder's idea had to do with traffic safety, and building an app that would record and send incident reports to the police for drunk-drivers, red-light violations, etc. When that didn't work out, I suggested an idea revolving around location-based messaging, and a geo-enabled bulletin board, which we pivoted to working on.</p>
			<p class="bodytext">As a "Product Manager" I took care of defining the scope, the aim, the use cases of the product, and also worked with the team to prioritize the feature set we would ship. I also oversaw all the visual design, as well as all the aspects of the user experience; this means I also did most of the asset work for our iPhone client, and lots and lots of sketches and flows. Below are a few screenshots of a recent version of the app:</p>

		<h2><a name="cloudtalk">Cloudtalk</a></h2><hr>
			<p class="bodytext">In the summer of 2010, I interned at a small software startup based in San Francisco. Cloudtalk (formerly Pana.ma), is a social network based around user's communicating asynchrously using recorded voice messages. I worked with the product management team to discuss feature ideas and write specs for the dev team. I also coded some proof-of-concept demos to show to the executive team. A good deal of my time was also done doing research into web trends, competing or successful web companies, and APIs of other products. Oh, and mockups too. Can't forget mockups.</p>

		<h2><a name="gloing">Gloing</a></h2><hr>
			<p class="bodytext">In my freshman year of college (fall 2008), I was approached by a Cal alumnus over facebook, who was recruiting students to help out with his new startup. The idea behind Gloing was to bring the relatively new idea of location-based social networking to the college campuses. I spent half a year working with a small team of 3 before the project as ultimately scrapped. I was responsible for anything that was needed, but mainly worked in UI/UX, creating mockups and user-flows, and offering direction and advice from a student user's perspective.</p>

I served as the team lead of a group of high schoolers and eventually took the top prize among 3 other teams and eventually presented to the executive team at eBay. Below are two short papers I wrote detailing my views on eBay's future as a product.</p>
